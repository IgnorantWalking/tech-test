## tech-test

The repository contains three different projects with the implementation of the following challenges. Every project contains the source code, test classes and a README.md file with some details.
### test-palindrome
Write an efficient algorithm to check if a string is a palindrome. A string is a palindrome if the string matches the reverse of string. 

### test-k-complementary
Write an efficient algorithm to find K-complementary pairs in a given array of integers.
Given Array A, pair (i, j) is K- complementary if K = A[i] + A[j];

### test-term-frequency
Tf/idf (term frequency / inverse document frequency) is an statistic that reflects the importance of a term T in a document D (or the relevance of a document for a searched term) relative to a document set S. 
See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf 

Tf/idf can be extended to a set of terms TT adding the tf/idf for each term.
